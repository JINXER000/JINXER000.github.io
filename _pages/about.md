I am a postdoctoral fellow at School of Computing and Data Science, The University of Hong Kong, under the leadership of [Prof. Jia Pan](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/jpan). 
Before that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree at Mechanical and Automation Engineering department, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Ben M. Chen](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/chen-benmei/). 


## Research Interests

 
- During Ph.D., I dedicated myself in developing intelligent robot planning and perception algorithms that enables real-world tasking. 
- After graduation, I shifted my interest in more challenging manipulation tasks that involves intricate physical constraints and human preference. 
- My current research interests lies in enhancing the performance of long-horizon manipulation tasks.
